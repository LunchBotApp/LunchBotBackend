  With the "/lunch" command, you can request suggestions for today's lunch specials. These suggestions will be based on your previous ratings and your settings.
  If you don't want to go eat alone, you can optionally add other users from your workspace to your group by refering to them with @Username.
  Furthermore you can uniquely change your settings. This can be done with "Setting=Value". The settings you can change are the following:
      price=x-y: determines the range for the price of the suggestions. x and y can be integers or positive decimal numbers with one or two digits to the left of the decimal point.
      location=Street Nr, ZIP City, Country: determines the location that is used for the distance calculation.
      distance=z: determines the maximum distance (in meters), between the restaurants and the specified location. z needs to be an integer.
